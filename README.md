# Bazel Templates

My personal templates for projects which use Bazel

## Requirements

- [Bazel](https://bazel.build)
- Basic Bazel knowledge
- Your favourite text editor

## Usage

1. Get the template (click on "Use this template")
2. Define project variables in the `tools/project.bzl` file
3. Add build and test rules in a BUILD file (examples of build rules are in the BUILD file)
4. Write your code
5. Build all rules. `bazel build //...`
